                <p id="description">This website provides an interactive visualization of Near-Earth 
                    Objects (NEOs) that are currently being tracked by NASA. NEOs are asteroids or comets 
                    whose orbits bring them into close proximity with Earth, making them subjects of 
                    great scientific interest. These objects are closely monitored by space agencies 
                    around the world to evaluate any potential risks they might pose to our planet and 
                    to gain deeper insights into their composition, trajectory, and behavior. By 
                    studying NEOs, scientists can better understand the dynamics of our solar system 
                    and the history of cosmic collisions that have shaped planetary bodies.<br><br>
                    This visualization uses data from the NASA NEOs API, which provides real-time information 
                    on asteroids and comets that come close to Earth. By clicking on any NEO name from the 
                    list on the left, you can explore detailed information about its size, speed, and how 
                    close it will pass by Earth. The size of each NEO is represented visually, compared 
                    to the silhouette of an average human figure, allowing you to grasp the scale of 
                    these space objects. You will also see key statistics such as the NEO's velocity, 
                    miss distance, and the date of its close approach. This tool is designed to offer 
                    a clear, intuitive understanding of how large these objects are.
