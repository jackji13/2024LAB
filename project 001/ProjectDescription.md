 Exercise: DOM

 Real-Life Object

The object I chose to interact with is an album cover. I first used Cinema 4D to create a simple album cover model, animated it, and exported a gltf file. After that, I built a scene using Three.js and set up the position, size, camera, and texture for the 3D model (the texture of the disk is from https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=album&search_type=usertyped&asset_id=56895138). I also downloaded "Sliding Envelope into Drawer.wav" from (https://freesound.org/people/MTJohnson/sounds/444426/) and edited it a bit in Adobe Audition. Then, I added an event listener to make this an interaction sound when the user clicks on an album cover. To make my life easier, I used a for loop to place 83 of my album covers onto the page from my assets folder. Finally, I laid out everything in the CSS using some flexboxes.
