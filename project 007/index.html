        This project explores how human design imposes rigid, geometric order onto the 
        natural world, which typically favors curves and irregular forms. Manhattanâ€™s 
        grid system, with its straight lines and sharp angles, is a prime example of 
        this contrast. By focusing on block corners along 5th Avenue, the project 
        highlights the ways in which urban planning creates a structured, repetitive 
        landscape that contrasts with the organic, unpredictable patterns found in 
        nature. These corners, though uniform in concept, carry subtle variations that 
        reveal the tension between human control and environmental influence. The 
        project invites reflection on how cities reshape natural spaces into orderly, 
        linear forms, emphasizing humanity's need for structure and control over its 
        surroundings.
